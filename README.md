# Controller for Mote®

Controller for Mote® is a simple open source application which lets you control your Pimoroni® Mote from your Android device. 

It requires Android v4.1 (Jelly Bean) or higher, and also requires that you install and run the required Mote API code on the device your Mote is plugged in to. The required Mote API code is available separately and can be found on GitHub at **[EarthstormSoftware/controllerformote-api](https://github.com/EarthstormSoftware/controllerformote-api)** along with full instructions.

You can find more information about Mote on the **[Pimoroni website](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mote)**.

### Raising Issues
Issues can be raised via the **[GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/EarthstormSoftware/controllerformote-android/issues)**

### Contributing
Before raising a pull request, it's recommended to raise an issue to enable discussion of the suggested change before spending time coding it. If there is no existing issue, please raise a new one. This is to reduce frustration at spending precious time crafting a change only for it to be rejected.

### Building the Code.
The repository should be able to be pulled directly into Android Studio, or onto a correctly configured standalone build system, and then built. Note that the default configuration is such that an example applicationId is used, and that the 'release' build task will **not** sign the apk. 

#### Trademarks
Pimoroni and Mote are trademarks of Pimoroni Ltd
